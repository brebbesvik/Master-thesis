\section{Focus group}
\section{Workshop}
The 22nd of February we had a workshop. The purpose of the workshop was to
\begin{itemize}
	\item Identify components in the treatment plan of asthma patients.
	\item Identify difficulty levels, and how the questions will be more detailed for every difficulty level.
	\item Make a learning map.
\end{itemize}

The antecedences for the meeting was 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Professor in computer science Yngve Lamo. Background in model driven engineering and health informatics.
	\item Assistant professor in computer science Svein Ivar Lillehaug. Background in health informatics.
	\item Postdoctoral fellow Fazle Rabbi. Background in model driven engineering.
	\item Medical doctor and PhD student in health informatics Job Nyangena.
	\item PhD research fellow in interaction design Rosaline Barendregt. Has written a master thesis in gamification.
	\item PhD candidate in computer science Suresh Kumar Mukhiya.
	\item Master degree student in computer science Ben-Richard Ebbesvik.	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reward system}
As each question in a quiz are related to a certain discipline or a certain task, the student will be measured how well he performed on each of these disciplines. For the asthma guideline, we have identified four disciplines. Assessment where the student will be tested in the initial examination. Diagnosis, where the student will determine a diagnosis as well as the severity. Management, where the student will determine which actions should be done to treat and best give the best care to the patient. The last discipline is the follow-up, where the student will be tested in evaluating the treatment, give advise to and educate patient and caregivers, provide the right medication and regular follow-up.

By splitting up the score in disciplines, the student can easily see which areas he is strong and where he needs more training. 



 We can also adapt the questions in each discipline to the students level. If the student has proven to be very good in providing the right amount of medicine to asthma patient, we can provide more difficult questions to challenge the student some more. If he struggles at setting the right diagnose, we can provide more basic questions to strengthen the students basic knowledge. 

\textcolor{red}{The disciplines should be automatically picked from the entity (and worflow?) model.}

\textcolor{red}{The tree structure of discipline scores. Diagnosis have examination, investigation, setting the severity. Management have advises, medication, admit, surgery and so on.}




The student will also be provided with a total score, which will be the average score of each of the disciplines. The student can compare the total score of e.g. the asthma quiz and the jaundice quiz, and see which medical condition he needs to train more on.

Each question will have several answer alternatives the student can choose from. Each answer alternative will have a reward or penalty related to them. The correct answer will have a great reward, while wrong answers will have a small penalty. The quiz author will have the opportunity to specify the rewards, such that he can give even smaller penalties for partly correct answers. The idea of the reward- penalty system is to increase learning. if the student answers wrong the first time, he will be given the possibility to reflect over the question once more or perhaps read the guideline to learn before he commits his second attempt. We are aware that providing a minus score for making an attempt can be very demotivating, but it is to avoid the situation where a student gets the same (or better) score for making ten attempts than only needing one attempt. A small penalty will have a very small impact when the reward per question is high, but in situations where the student performs very poorly and ends with a negative total score, it is possible to adjust this to a small positive score on presentation for the student. Not giving a too harsh feedback for trying to learn.

\textcolor{red}{A solution to having a not very strict game, encouraging to playing and learning, one can also have a very strict examination version. The idea is that after examination, the results will be sent to the lecturer (or a governing body of some kind) to evaluate what the overall knowledge of the students, as well as details of what the students are really good in and where do they struggle. The lecturer can then target the weak of points of the students in one of the next lectures. }


\subsection{Unlocking harder levels at a certain category}
\textcolor{red}{(somewhere in the paper I need to refer to Eides, Kristensens and Lamos paper, and discuss the knowledge, learning and student maps and that they need to prove basic knowledge in some disciplines before they can unlock content in other disciplines.)}

\chapter{Discussion}
\section{Research questions}
\section{Limitations of the model}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Can't ask questions like "what are the symptoms for severe asthma?"
	\item Difficult to ask what NOT to do. If the vertex doesn't exist, only an empty string gets returned. Can only be used were we actually have written "don't admit to the hospital" as an example with hospitalization.
	\item The inheritance makes it difficult to generalize some questions. We can't make a template which asks about the Rate a medicine should be taken with. We need to specifically ask for that medicine. To be able to ask for a general medicine, one solution can be to introduce a new tag which compares the substring of the type of the vertex. Another solution is to use the meta model and not the instance model. We don't use inheritance on diagnosis because of this.
	\item To avoid the problem described in the previous point, we don't use inheritance on Diagnosis. A limitation here is that  
	a patient can only have one diagnosis.
