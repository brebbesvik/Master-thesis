\chapter{Discussion}
Right now we have modelled parts of the guideline for prescribing oxygen \parencite{RepublicofKeny2016} and antibiotic administration \parencite{RepublicofKeny2016} into the entity model of the paediatric possible asthma guideline \parencite{RepublicofKeny2016}. This is to be able to ask detailed questions about relevant treatment, as well as making sure that the student knows the basics of the treatment. In a future version we can have separate quizzes for prescribing oxygen and antibiotic administration. We have already applied Dynamic Content Management (DCM) to the asthma quiz, but we can also apply it to a higher abstraction level. We can say that the student needs to complete the quizzes for prescribing oxygen and antibiotic administration, before he is allowed to play the asthma quiz. Then we have a knowledge dependency. According to DCM he can choose whether he wants to complete prescribing oxygen first or antibiotic administration first, but both have to be completed to advance to the paediatric possible asthma guideline.

\appendix
\chapter{Comparison of CPG applications}\label{appendix:ComparisonApps}
This appendix shows two comparative tables of applications and websites that display clinical guidelines; one for international applications and one for Norwegian applications. The selection is based on a few articles concerning apps for clinical practice and a search for clinical guideline applications on Google Play.
Helsebiblioteket provides access for Norwegian health workers and students to some of the applications and websites below [1], but users do not explicitly need accounts for this.
