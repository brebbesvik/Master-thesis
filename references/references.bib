abstract = {The effects on learning of three feedback strategies (Answer Until Correct, Knowledge of Correct Response, and Delayed) were compared to two control strategies (No feedback and No questions) under two conditions of incentives. Task incentives rewarded subjects for successful task completion regardless of level of achievement while performance incentives based subjectsâ€² actual grades on level of achievement. Results showed an overall effect favoring performance incentives across all levels of learning and feedback conditions. KCR and Delayed feedback strategies were advantageous for lower-level learning only, that is where post-test questions were similar to original practice questions. AUC feedback, however, was not effective on any learning measure. Results are interpreted with regard to the interaction of feedback form and learner dispositions to process feedback information "mindfully" rather than in a surface manner.},

abstract = {In a study of mathematics problem solving, the effect of providing multiple-try feedback on later success in solving similar problems was examined. Participants solved mathematics problems that were presented as either multiple-choice or open-ended questions, and were provided with one of four types of feedback: no feedback (NF), immediate knowledge of the correct response (KCR), multiple-try feedback with knowledge of the correct response (MTC), or multiple-try feedback with hints after an initial incorrect response (MTH). Results showed that gains in performance were larger in the open-ended than multiple-choice condition. Furthermore, gains under NF and KCR were similar, gains were larger under MTC than KCR, and gains were larger under MTH than MTC. The implications of these results for the design of assessments for learning are discussed.},

abstract = {Transferring results of research into clinical practice and their effective use for decisions in health care have become a major concern and are pivotal to quality improvement. Among the tools that have been developed are clinical practice guidelines (CPG). Developing reliable and valid recommendations requires a rigorous methodological approach that combines a systematic review of the results of clinical research with expert, pondered and explicit judgment. Guaranteeing applicability and implementation of these recommendations implies asking the question of how acceptable the recommendations are for the patient, the availability of the procedure and the expertise necessary in the specific context as well as identification of the organizational impact when put into action. CPG are a source of information not only for physicians but also for policy makers, insurance institutions, continued education programs and production of information for high quality decision making for patients.},

@article{Cabana1999,
abstract = {ContextDespite wide promulgation, clinical practice guidelines have had limited
effect on changing physician behavior. Little is known about the process and
factors involved in changing physician practices in response to guidelines.ObjectiveTo review barriers to physician adherence to clinical practice guidelines.Data SourcesWe searched the MEDLINE, Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC),
and HealthSTAR databases (January 1966 to January 1998); bibliographies; textbooks
on health behavior or public health; and references supplied by experts to
find English-language article titles that describe barriers to guideline adherence.Study SelectionOf 5658 articles initially identified, we selected 76 published studies
describing at least 1 barrier to adherence to clinical practice guidelines,
practice parameters, clinical policies, or national consensus statements.
One investigator screened titles to identify candidate articles, then 2 investigators
independently reviewed the texts to exclude articles that did not match the
criteria. Differences were resolved by consensus with a third investigator.Data ExtractionTwo investigators organized barriers to adherence into a framework according
to their effect on physician knowledge, attitudes, or behavior. This organization
was validated by 3 additional investigators.Data SynthesisThe 76 articles included 120 different surveys investigating 293 potential
barriers to physician guideline adherence, including awareness (n = 46), familiarity
(n = 31), agreement (n = 33), self-efficacy (n = 19), outcome expectancy (n
= 8), ability to overcome the inertia of previous practice (n = 14), and absence
of external barriers to perform recommendations (n = 34). The majority of
surveys (70 [58{\%}] of 120) examined only 1 type of barrier.ConclusionsStudies on improving physician guideline adherence may not be generalizable,
since barriers in one setting may not be present in another. Our review offers
a differential diagnosis for why physicians do not follow practice guidelines,
as well as a rational approach toward improving guideline adherence and a
framework for future research.},

@article{Masic2008,
abstract = {CONFLICT OF INTEREST NONE DECLARED Evidence based medicine (EBM) is the conscientious, explicit, judicious and reasonable use of modern, best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. EBM integrates clinical experience and patient values with the best available research information. It is a movement which aims to increase the use of high quality clinical research in clinical decision making. EBM requires new skills of the clinician, including efficient literature-searching, and the application of formal rules of evidence in evaluating the clinical literature. The practice of evidence-based medicine is a process of lifelong, self-directed, problem-based learning in which caring for one's own patients creates the need for clinically important information about diagnosis, prognosis, therapy and other clinical and health care issues. It is not "cookbook" with recipes, but its good application brings cost-effective and better health care. The key difference between evidence-based medicine and traditional medicine is not that EBM considers the evidence while the latter does not. Both take evidence into account; however, EBM demands better evidence than has traditionally been used. One of the greatest achievements of evidence-based medicine has been the development of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, methods by which researchers identify multiple studies on a topic, separate the best ones and then critically analyze them to come up with a summary of the best available evidence. The EBM-oriented clinicians of tomorrow have three tasks: a) to use evidence summaries in clinical practice; b) to help develop and update selected systematic reviews or evidence-based guidelines in their area of expertise; and c) to enrol patients in studies of treatment, diagnosis and prognosis on which medical practice is based.},

abstract = {To address the recognized problems associated with information overload and limited human memory, computer-based systems which help healthcare providers use information to make better decisions have been developed and implemented. These decision aids are designed to improve the quality and reduce the cost of healthcare. Currently, the most widely used computer application is to simply provide needed facts about the patient in an organized and timely fashion. Additionally, healthcare workers can access literature, ask questions of aggregates of patient data for clinical or administrative decisions, receive warnings or suggestions when the patient's data satisfy certain logical rules receive critiques when proposing therapies or ordering diagnostic tests, receive guidelines for standards of care, access programs which analyze tradeoffs and likelihoods of alternative outcomes (decision analysis) and receive lists of differential diagnoses. Given this wonderful panoply of capabilities, the question becomes 'why aren't more people using these aids and what are the demonstrated benefits of such capabilities?' In this paper we review the types of decision aids which have been successfully implemented and the challenges to implementation (knowledge representation, connections to databases, need for comprehensive, coded databases and evaluation of benefits).},

@book{Guidelines2011,
abstract = {Advances in medical, biomedical and health services research have reduced the level of uncertainty in clinical practice. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) complement this progress by establishing standards of care backed by strong scientific evidence. CPGs are statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care. These statements are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and costs of alternative care options. Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust examines the current state of clinical practice guidelines and how they can be improved to enhance healthcare quality and patient outcomes. Clinical practice guidelines now are ubiquitous in our healthcare system. The Guidelines International Network (GIN) database currently lists more than 3,700 guidelines from 39 countries. Developing guidelines presents a number of challenges including lack of transparent methodological practices, difficulty reconciling conflicting guidelines, and conflicts of interest. Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust explores questions surrounding the quality of CPG development processes and the establishment of standards. It proposes eight standards for developing trustworthy clinical practice guidelines emphasizing transparency; management of conflict of interest ; systematic review--guideline development intersection; establishing evidence foundations for and rating strength of guideline recommendations; articulation of recommendations; external review; and updating. Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust shows how clinical practice guidelines can enhance clinician and patient decision-making by translating complex scientific research findings into recommendations for clinical practice that are relevant to the individual patient encounter, instead of implementing a one size fits all approach to patient care. This book contains information directly related to the work of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), as well as various Congressional staff and policymakers. It is a vital resource for medical specialty societies, disease advocacy groups, health professionals, private and international organizations that develop or use clinical practice guidelines, consumers, clinicians, and payers.},
