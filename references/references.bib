GLIF version 2 enabled modeling a guideline as a flowchart of structured steps, representing clinical actions and decisions. However, the attributes of structured constructs were defined as text strings that could not be parsed, and such guidelines could not be used for computer-based execution that requires automatic inference. GLIF3 is a new version of GLIF designed to support computer-based execution. GLIF3 builds upon the framework set by GLIF2 but augments it by introducing several new constructs and extending GLIF2 constructs to allow a more formal definition of decision criteria, action specifications and patient data. GLIF3 enables guideline encoding at three levels: a conceptual flowchart, a computable specification that can be verified for logical consistency and completeness, and an implementable specification that can be incorporated into particular institutional information systems.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES Many groups are developing computer-interpretable clinical guidelines (CIGs) for use during clinical encounters. CIGs use "Task-Network Models" for representation but differ in their approaches to addressing particular modeling challenges. We have studied similarities and differences between CIGs in order to identify issues that must be resolved before a consensus on a set of common components can be developed. DESIGN We compared six models: Asbru, EON, GLIF, GUIDE, PRODIGY, and PROforma. Collaborators from groups that created these models represented, in their own formalisms, portions of two guidelines: American College of Chest Physicians cough guidelines [correction] and the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. MEASUREMENTS We compared the models according to eight components that capture the structure of CIGs. The components enable modelers to encode guidelines as plans that organize decision and action tasks in networks. They also enable the encoded guidelines to be linked with patient data-a key requirement for enabling patient-specific decision support. RESULTS We found consensus on many components, including plan organization, expression language, conceptual medical record model, medical concept model, and data abstractions. Differences were most apparent in underlying decision models, goal representation, use of scenarios, and structured medical actions. CONCLUSION We identified guideline components that the CIG community could adopt as standards. Some of the participants are pursuing standardization of these components under the auspices of HL7.},

abstract = {The Guideline Interchange Format (GLIF) is a model for representation of sharable computer-interpretable guidelines. The current version of GLIF (GLIF3) is a substantial update and enhancement of the model since the previous version (GLIF2). GLIF3 enables encoding of a guideline at three levels: a conceptual flowchart, a computable specification that can be verified for logical consistency and completeness, and an implementable specification that is intended to be incorporated into particular institutional information systems. The representation has been tested on a wide variety of guidelines that are typical of the range of guidelines in clinical use. It builds upon GLIF2 by adding several constructs that enable interpretation of encoded guidelines in computer-based decision-support systems. GLIF3 leverages standards being developed in Health Level 7 in order to allow integration of guidelines with clinical information systems. The GLIF3 specification consists of an extensible object-oriented model and a structured syntax based on the resource description framework (RDF). Empirical validation of the ability to generate appropriate recommendations using GLIF3 has been tested by executing encoded guidelines against actual patient data. GLIF3 is accordingly ready for broader experimentation and prototype use by organizations that wish to evaluate its ability to capture the logic of clinical guidelines, to implement them in clinical systems, and thereby to provide integrated decision support to assist clinicians.},

As technology matured, interactive products became not only more useful and usable, but also fashionable, fascinating things to desire. Driven by the impression that a narrow focus on interactive products as tools does not capture the variety and emerging aspects of technology use, practitioners and researchers alike, seem to readily embrace the notion of UX as a viable alternative to traditional HCI. And, indeed, the term promises change and a fresh look, without being too specific about its definite meaning. The present introduction to the special issue on 'Empirical studies of the user experience' attempts to give a provisional answer to the question of what is meant by 'the user experience'. It provides a cursory sketch of UX and how we think UX research will look like in the future. It is not so much meant as a forecast of the future, but as a proposal - a stimulus...},

abstract = {ContextDespite wide promulgation, clinical practice guidelines have had limited
effect on changing physician behavior. Little is known about the process and
factors involved in changing physician practices in response to guidelines.ObjectiveTo review barriers to physician adherence to clinical practice guidelines.Data SourcesWe searched the MEDLINE, Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC),
and HealthSTAR databases (January 1966 to January 1998); bibliographies; textbooks
on health behavior or public health; and references supplied by experts to
find English-language article titles that describe barriers to guideline adherence.Study SelectionOf 5658 articles initially identified, we selected 76 published studies
describing at least 1 barrier to adherence to clinical practice guidelines,
practice parameters, clinical policies, or national consensus statements.
One investigator screened titles to identify candidate articles, then 2 investigators
independently reviewed the texts to exclude articles that did not match the
criteria. Differences were resolved by consensus with a third investigator.Data ExtractionTwo investigators organized barriers to adherence into a framework according
to their effect on physician knowledge, attitudes, or behavior. This organization
was validated by 3 additional investigators.Data SynthesisThe 76 articles included 120 different surveys investigating 293 potential
barriers to physician guideline adherence, including awareness (n = 46), familiarity
(n = 31), agreement (n = 33), self-efficacy (n = 19), outcome expectancy (n
= 8), ability to overcome the inertia of previous practice (n = 14), and absence
of external barriers to perform recommendations (n = 34). The majority of
surveys (70 [58{\%}] of 120) examined only 1 type of barrier.ConclusionsStudies on improving physician guideline adherence may not be generalizable,
since barriers in one setting may not be present in another. Our review offers
a differential diagnosis for why physicians do not follow practice guidelines,
as well as a rational approach toward improving guideline adherence and a
framework for future research.},

abstract = {Advances in medical, biomedical and health services research have reduced the level of uncertainty in clinical practice. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) complement this progress by establishing standards of care backed by strong scientific evidence. CPGs are statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care. These statements are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and costs of alternative care options. Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust examines the current state of clinical practice guidelines and how they can be improved to enhance healthcare quality and patient outcomes. Clinical practice guidelines now are ubiquitous in our healthcare system. The Guidelines International Network (GIN) database currently lists more than 3,700 guidelines from 39 countries. Developing guidelines presents a number of challenges including lack of transparent methodological practices, difficulty reconciling conflicting guidelines, and conflicts of interest. Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust explores questions surrounding the quality of CPG development processes and the establishment of standards. It proposes eight standards for developing trustworthy clinical practice guidelines emphasizing transparency; management of conflict of interest ; systematic review--guideline development intersection; establishing evidence foundations for and rating strength of guideline recommendations; articulation of recommendations; external review; and updating. Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust shows how clinical practice guidelines can enhance clinician and patient decision-making by translating complex scientific research findings into recommendations for clinical practice that are relevant to the individual patient encounter, instead of implementing a one size fits all approach to patient care. This book contains information directly related to the work of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), as well as various Congressional staff and policymakers. It is a vital resource for medical specialty societies, disease advocacy groups, health professionals, private and international organizations that develop or use clinical practice guidelines, consumers, clinicians, and payers.},

Guideline developers around the world are inconsistent in how they rate quality of evidence and grade strength of recommendations. As a result, guideline users face challenges in understanding the messages that grading systems try to communicate. Since 2006 the BMJ has requested in its “Instructions to Authors” on bmj.com that authors should preferably use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system for grading evidence when submitting a clinical guidelines article. What was behind this decision?

In this first in a series of five articles we will explain why many organisations use formal systems to grade evidence and recommendations and why this is important for clinicians; we will focus on the GRADE approach to recommendations. In the next two articles we will examine how the GRADE system categorises quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. The final two articles will {\ldots}},

abstract = {CONFLICT OF INTEREST NONE DECLARED Evidence based medicine (EBM) is the conscientious, explicit, judicious and reasonable use of modern, best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. EBM integrates clinical experience and patient values with the best available research information. It is a movement which aims to increase the use of high quality clinical research in clinical decision making. EBM requires new skills of the clinician, including efficient literature-searching, and the application of formal rules of evidence in evaluating the clinical literature. The practice of evidence-based medicine is a process of lifelong, self-directed, problem-based learning in which caring for one's own patients creates the need for clinically important information about diagnosis, prognosis, therapy and other clinical and health care issues. It is not "cookbook" with recipes, but its good application brings cost-effective and better health care. The key difference between evidence-based medicine and traditional medicine is not that EBM considers the evidence while the latter does not. Both take evidence into account; however, EBM demands better evidence than has traditionally been used. One of the greatest achievements of evidence-based medicine has been the development of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, methods by which researchers identify multiple studies on a topic, separate the best ones and then critically analyze them to come up with a summary of the best available evidence. The EBM-oriented clinicians of tomorrow have three tasks: a) to use evidence summaries in clinical practice; b) to help develop and update selected systematic reviews or evidence-based guidelines in their area of expertise; and c) to enrol patients in studies of treatment, diagnosis and prognosis on which medical practice is based.},

abstract = {To address the recognized problems associated with information overload and limited human memory, computer-based systems which help healthcare providers use information to make better decisions have been developed and implemented. These decision aids are designed to improve the quality and reduce the cost of healthcare. Currently, the most widely used computer application is to simply provide needed facts about the patient in an organized and timely fashion. Additionally, healthcare workers can access literature, ask questions of aggregates of patient data for clinical or administrative decisions, receive warnings or suggestions when the patient's data satisfy certain logical rules receive critiques when proposing therapies or ordering diagnostic tests, receive guidelines for standards of care, access programs which analyze tradeoffs and likelihoods of alternative outcomes (decision analysis) and receive lists of differential diagnoses. Given this wonderful panoply of capabilities, the question becomes 'why aren't more people using these aids and what are the demonstrated benefits of such capabilities?' In this paper we review the types of decision aids which have been successfully implemented and the challenges to implementation (knowledge representation, connections to databases, need for comprehensive, coded databases and evaluation of benefits).},

abstract = {The effects on learning of three feedback strategies (Answer Until Correct, Knowledge of Correct Response, and Delayed) were compared to two control strategies (No feedback and No questions) under two conditions of incentives. Task incentives rewarded subjects for successful task completion regardless of level of achievement while performance incentives based subjects′ actual grades on level of achievement. Results showed an overall effect favoring performance incentives across all levels of learning and feedback conditions. KCR and Delayed feedback strategies were advantageous for lower-level learning only, that is where post-test questions were similar to original practice questions. AUC feedback, however, was not effective on any learning measure. Results are interpreted with regard to the interaction of feedback form and learner dispositions to process feedback information "mindfully" rather than in a surface manner.},
