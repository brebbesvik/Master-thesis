\subsection{Workshop}
The 22nd of February 2019 we had a workshop. The purpose of the workshop was to
\begin{itemize}
	\item Identify components in the treatment plan of asthma patients.
	\item Identify difficulty levels, and how the questions will be more detailed for every difficulty level.
	\item Make a map of the learning content. Where the content is categorized in components and difficulty levels.  Identify paths the student can take through the learning content.f 
\end{itemize}

The meeting started with the master student informing the status of the project by doing a cognitive walk-through and a demonstration of the application. 

The professor presented ideas for further development of the application. The important thing, was the concept of splitting up the questions in themes which relates to components in the treatment plan. The medical doctor helped identify these themes as assessment, diagnosis, management and treatment. Further we identified what type of questions we wanted to ask, and how they fits into different difficulty levels, based on the details of the questions. We ask factual questions for level 1. We use scenarios in level 2, where we apply facts and the detail level is categories. I.e. what class of medication should be administered to the patient. In level 3 we continue with scenarios, but here we ask for much more details, like the dosage of a medication or how often it should be administered. See figure \ref{table:QuestionsDetailLevels} to for an example of how the detail level gets higher as the student progress.

\begin{table}[h!]
	\label{table:QuestionsDetailLevels}
	\begin{tabular}{ | m{2em} | m{7em}| m{5.5em} | m{5em}| m{7.5em} |} 
		\hline
		Level & Question & Answer key & Distractions & Explanation \\
		\hline
		1 & Which of the following class of drugs is NOT indicated in the immediate management of severe asthma? & Inhaled corticosteroids & Short acting beta agonists, Oral corticosteroids, Anti-cholinergics & Inhaled corticosteroids are not indicated for acute management of asthma, they're indicated for long term control of symptoms \\
		\hline
		2 & Karen is found to be experiencing severe asthma and is given salbutamol. What other medications should she be given? & Prednisolone and oxygen & Ipratropium bromide, Formoterol & When  treating a patient with severe asthma, always start with oxygen, salbutamol and prednisolone. The evaluation of how the patient responds, will determine the next step of the treatment \\ 
		\hline
		3 & You diagnos Malin with severe asthma and initiate a treatment plan. What dose of salbutamol will you administer with the nebulizer? & 2.5mg & 3.5mg, 4.5mg, 5.5mg & In the scenario of severe asthma, nebulize 2.5mg of salbutamol \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\caption{As the student progress to higher difficulty levels, the questions will ask for more details. Here we show the detail levels of Management}
\end{table}

When playing level 1 the student should get questions from all themes in level 1. When the student completes level 1, the student should no longer get questions from that theme. This is to avoid boring the user by repeating the questions the student already knows the answer of. He should only get questions from themes he struggles with. I.e. on the first run level 1, the user gets every question in assessment right, but have some mistakes with diagnosis and management. Then on the next run, he only gets questions from level 1 diagnosis and management. This continues until he has reached the passing condition on every theme in level 1. 

We further identified a dependency in the treatment plan. To be able to do a follow-up, the students first needs to know something about assessment, diagnosis and management of the patient. The follow-up is actually an evaluation of the treatment which have been given, based on the suggested diagnosis. The evaluation will tell how the patient responded to the treatment, and the student needs to take actions whether the patient responded or his condition became better or worse. When we have such a dependency, the student needs to complete assessment, diagnosis and management before follow-up gets unlocked. Since follow-up is only relevant in a situation where there has already been set a diagnosis and given a treatment, the follow-up is only part of level 2 and 3, where the questions are given as scenarios.

		\caption {The student needs to acquire basic knowledge about assessment, diagnosis, management, before he can follow-up the treatment. This is a prerequisite for follow-up}
\end{figure}

To complete a level, all passing conditions at that level in each theme have to be met. When the student qualifies for a new level, he only gets questions from the level he plays. The same concept of only getting questions from the themes at that level you haven't met the passing condition, continues for level 2 and 3. 

We planned to have a visualization of the passing condition in the application. The passing condition will be shown in a chart in the summary section after each game. The passing condition will be marked as a line over every theme for the level the student plays. The students scores for each theme at that level be shown as bars. When a bar reaches the line, a passing condition is met.

The medical doctor continued the meeting by talking about the guidelines. The paediatric guideline of asthma is called "possible asthma". That is because in an emergency situation asthma is the most dangerous airway condition and can be lethal. If the patient shows signs of asthma, he will be treated for asthma to reduce risks of an unwanted scenario.

We identified users of the application: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Formal training, where last year medical students are reading for their exams.
	\item Anyone can learn, so it can be used to inform and educate the public.
	\item In countries such as Kenya, where there are a large deficit in doctors and nurses, sometimes nurses has to work as doctors. Or community workers need to take the role as doctor or nurse. The application will help educating nurses and community workers for such scenarios.
\end{itemize}
 
 There was also talked about how the situation in medical training is for the student. When a patient comes to the emergency room with severe asthma, the medical doctors will have all their focus on that particular patient. The medical student will typically not take part in the assessment, diagnosis or the initial treatment of the patient. The medical student will typically only take part in the monitoring, evaluation and follow-up of the patient, when the situation is less critical. The application will give the medical student an alternative way to train in assessment, diagnosis and initial treatment of a made-up patient with severe asthma. 

The medical doctor continued the workshop by going through the Kenyan paediatric guideline of possible asthma \parencite{RepublicofKeny2016}. This is the guideline we will base our quiz on. The medical doctor answered questions from the group about details of the guideline. It is important to understand the general flow as well as the details to be able to make good questions for the quiz. The guidelines is poorly written in terms of wrong use of sentential operators. These mistakes needed to be clarified.

The rest of the workshop was for the participants brainstorming around the questions which will be used in the quiz. Each participant wrote questions on post-it notes, and placed them at a suiting level and theme on the blackboard. At the end, The medical doctor went through the questions and we had a small discussion around the suggested questions. We managed to produce question templates to be used in asthma quiz of the application.
