	\item Dynamic Content Management \parencite{Eide2008} is a model for e-learning systems. It defines concepts like knowledge map, learning map and student map, which the two first are used to organize the learning content, while student map is the learners path through the learning content. By dividing the learning content into atomic units of knowledge and identify knowledge dependencies, we can organize the learning material such that it is adaptable to the knowledge level of the learner, and flexible such that the learner can go through the learning in several ways as long as the knowledge dependencies are fulfilled.
