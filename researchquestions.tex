\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{RQ1:} Based on clinical guidelines, how can we define and represent a generic data structure that can be used to implement applications such as online guidelines or training games for such guidelines, and where applications can adapt to the level of their users?
	\item \textbf{RQ2:} Can the generic data structure in RQ1 be used to generate a specific data model for another domain such as paediatric asthma?
	\item \textbf{RQ3:} How can we use the data model in RQ2 to implement a game for guideline training that can adapt to the level and progression  of users?
	\item \textbf{RQ4:} Is the guideline meta model at an abstraction level such that it can be used for other guidelines? 
	\item \textbf{RQ5:}
