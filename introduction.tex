\section{Paper publication}
In December 2018, we submitted a paper "A Model Driven Approach to the Development of Gamified Interactive Clinical Practice Guidelines", which was a summary of our work so far in this project and related projects. The paper was accepted for publication by ENASE 2019 â€“ 14th International Conference on Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering, where we held a presentation on their conference in Heraklion, Greece. 

The paper can be found in appendix \ref{appendix:Paper} in this thesis.

%\section{Old Research questions}
%\begin{itemize}
	%\item Can we make a data structure representing the paediatric possible asthma guideline \parencite{RepublicofKeny2016}  in a very generic way?
	%\item Based on the data structure, can we generate suitable scenarios, with multiple choice %question with answer elements for training and evaluating health personnel?
	%\item How can we structure the learning material to best train medical students, doctors, clinical officers, nurses and other health workers in the paediatric possible asthma guideline \parencite{RepublicofKeny2016}? 
			%\item Based on clinical guidelines, can we make a reusable data structure representing respiratory diseases for use in serious games?


%-------
%	\item Based on clinical guidelines, can we make a data structure which is easy to implement in the system, as well as adaptable? 
	
%	\item How to use such a model for generating and testing case based multiple choice questions and answer elements?
	%\item Can we use the data model to structure the learning content such that it is adapted to the current knowledge of the individual learner?
	
	
%	\item How can we model the work-flow of a clinical encounter, a patient at a given point in the clinical encounter, and a student at the current point in his learning process. How to represent these?

\section{Summary}
Here we have defined a set of research questions, which is related to the development of serious games for clinical guidelines. Making games which are adaptable to the knowledge level, progression of the user, and making guideline models which are at an abstraction level where they can be used to represent other CPGs, are the main focus points.

We have also given a short presentation of each chapter in the thesis.
