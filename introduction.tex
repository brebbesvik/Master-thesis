\section{Research questions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Can we make a data structure representing the paediatric possible asthma guideline \cite{RepublicofKeny2016}  in a very generic way?
	\item Based on the data structure, can we generate suitable scenarios, with multiple choice question with answer elements for training and evaluating health personnel?
	\item How can we structure the learning material to best train medical students, doctors, clinical officers, nurses and other health workers in the paediatric possible asthma guideline \cite{RepublicofKeny2016}? 
\end{itemize}
